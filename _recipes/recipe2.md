**Prep Time:** 15minutes 

**Servings:** 1 cocktail, can be multiplied

## *Ingredients* 

* Cherry Simple Syrup
*  1 ½ cups Cherries
* 1 cup water
* 1 cup sugar
* 4 ounces dark spiced rum
* 12 ounces cold Coca-Cola
* ½ cup whole cherries for garnish 

##  *Method*

##### *Step 1*

To make the cherry syrup, you need to mix your cherries, chopped and sliced into a medium saucepan with your sugar and water on a medium heat, and bring it to simmer. Let the mixture heat up for about 5 minutes or so, until all the sugar has dissolved, and the mixture is starting to thicken evenly. 

##### *Step 2*

The next step is to add your cherry syrup mixture to a blender, blend it on high until it forms a puree like consistency. At this step you can strain if you desire a smooth syrup, but that is entirely up to you. After you have finished these steps, you need pour it in a bowl and cool for around 5 minutes, depending on how hot it is. 

##### *Step 3*

After the cherry syrup is cooled, fill a tall sized glass with ice and add your chopped pitted cherries, then add in 2 tablespoons of the cherry syrup and fill the glass up with iced cold Coca-Cola. Use a spoon to stir and garnish with two cherries on top for decoration. Then it’s ready to serve!
