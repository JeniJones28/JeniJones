Â Racial Diversity is severely lacking in the romance publishing  right now with 10% of all romance novels being multicultural, demonstrating just how crucial it needs to change. However, the term whitewashing comes into this, with publishers purposely covering up or placing a white person on the cover despite the heroine being of colour. Which has had a severe impact on the progression for diversity in romance genre. A prime example of this would be through Bloomsbury's publication of Liar by Justine Larbalestier. This novel held countless debates about its cover design, which was originally a cover of a white female, despite the fact that the heroine was black, which brought a lot of criticism and outrage by the readers. 

Whch led them to change the cover to a beautful light skinned black African American woman. Although this seems reasonable that it was changed, it should not in any circumstance should have happened in the first place. Alongside the fact that the character represented in Liar, was of a darker skin colour, with different hair and generally had masculine attributes. However, in the cover published it was far from that, truly highlighting how corrupt the publishing industry is and how much it needs to change. Alongside reader tastes that are demanding racial diversity in romance, making this need even more crucial right now.
