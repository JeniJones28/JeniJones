The publishing industry started to change in 2012 as a result of the evolution of self-publishing. This had a particular impact on the romance publishing industry as it has allowed for a more diverse range of romances narratives to appear, catering to a more diverse taste. As traditional publishers operate using very broad and basic subcategories on romance, it can be extremely difficult for readers to find a specific form of romance. Even though Young Adult books are put in subcategories such as romance, sci-fi and crime they are still clustered and intertwined together. This makes the categories very  general for readers who desire a very particular and specialised narrative. 

 But why is self-publishing different?  Traditional publishers operate on very strict guidelines and regulations. Therefore, romance plots need to stick to the traditional romance framework, conforming to the standards needed for both what the publisher want to publish but also how publishers want to convey their reputation, whether they want to publish titles outside the box, or more conventional. This may make writers feel like their opinions are not important with publishers focused on the standards and the framework, it can often seem like the publisher has the most control over the publication. However, self-publishing removes these potential barriers. This has ultimately been the number one cause for the major divide in the industry. Self-publishing provides a platform for writers to have full control to write without restriction, allowing them to have freedom with the narrative they choose. This is the main reason why romance authors are choosing self-publishing, because it allows them to have free creative control on their titles and how they want to convey the narrative to their choosing.
